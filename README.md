# ENUMERABLE
Enumerable Methods

In this project, you have implemented my own version of Ruby’s enumerable methods.
There are two (02) files in this project:
enumerable.rb : list of my enumerable methods.
test.rb: file test for enumerable methods

The goal here is to prove that there's no magic with Ruby’s enumerable methods.
